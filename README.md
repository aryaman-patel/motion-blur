# Removing Motion Blur
This project aims to predict the blur kernel using an FCN, that can be used to deblur an images using Non-blind deconvolution.

## Instruction to project: 

The `dataset_old` folder includes an example dataset of an image from the BSD300 dataset. The images have been simulated using the [data generation code](https://github.com/donggong1/motion-flow-syn) from the project page to show the flow and the blur patterns. 

The `model.py` contains the entire FCN architecture as illustrated in the paper:

The model can also be trained on the included dataset.

The `preprocess_data.py` folder contains the the code to resize all the images to a standard size of `300x460` for the model to process them. The example dataset has already been preprocessed to this size. 

In order to see the results on the example image, run the `flow_field.py` file that produces the optical flow vector field, of the results `result_flowfield.mat` obtained by running inference on an example image `8143_021_blurryimg.png`.
